Title
PHASE-1-CODE CHALLENGES

Description
Learning Goals

use codes to get solution for the challengess
Perform operations and execute solutions

Introduction
Setup instructions

We covered the concepts in JavaScript. Now it's time to put the concepts into practice.

If you haven't already, fork and clone this lab into your local environment. Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run code . to open the files in Visual Studio Code.

Instructions
Follow the steps below, running learn test as you go to get additional information from the tests.

There are 3 code challenges in this page, each challenge should be executed and solutions clearly seen 
Each challenge contains a question to which should be coded in the visual studio code and the code expected to run for each of the question.

in the main folder in the vs code ,there are three other sub folders containing solutions to each question .
 
 To start, define a function in each question that will be able to execute the code in vs code

Once you've initialized the variables ,you will need now to do the code challenge in vs code using javascript.

After coding and seeing that your code runs as expected,you should save your work to prevent data loss.
After saving your work.you should go ahead and submit the work and push it to your github account.
